# Banner Ad Library 

This is a simple library to help with Display of banner ads.

## Usage

It uses composer autoload and it can be used directly. 
Usage is demonstrated on the `index.php` file.

## Running Tests
1. Run `composer install` in order to generate the autoloader and install `phpunit` for tests.
2. Once composer is installed run ``./vendor/bin/phpunit --debug --stop-on-failure`` to run the test.
3. Additionally you can also run `./vendor/bin/phpunit --debug --stop-on-failure --coverage-text` if php-xdebug is installed for a beautiful test coverage report.
